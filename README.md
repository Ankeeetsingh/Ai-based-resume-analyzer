# AI-Based Resume Analyzer

This intelligent web application automates and enhances the resume screening process using advanced AI.

## 🔍 Features

- Analyze resumes using the **Gemini LLM**
- Input job title, description, expected salary, and number of candidates
- Get **match scores**, **skill assessments**, and **salary suggestions**
- Generate **personalized interview questions** with **model answers**
- One-click **automated rejection emails**

## 🛠 Technologies Used

Frontend: The part of the website users interact with (Next.js and Tailwind CSS help
you build this).
 Backend: The part of the website that handles things behind the scenes (Next.js,
Genkit, and Firebase are involved here).
 AI/ML: AI models analyze data like resumes and job descriptions (using Genkit and
LLMs).
 UI Components: Ready-to-use elements (like buttons and forms) to make the website
look nice (shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS).
 Data Validation: Ensures the data being input is correct (using Zod).
 Email Service: Sends emails (using Nodemailer).
 Additional Libraries: Tools to handle icons, CSS classes, date formatting, and form
management (lucide-react, clsx, date-fns, react-hook-form).

## 🚀 How It Works

1. HR uploads job details and multiple resumes
2. AI analyzes each resume and ranks candidates
3. Results include detailed scoring, insights, and salary prediction
4. System can send automatic rejection emails to unselected candidates
