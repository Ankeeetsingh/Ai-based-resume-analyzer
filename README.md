## 🛠 Technologies Used

Frontend: The part of the website users interact with (Next.js and Tailwind CSS help
you build this).
 Backend: The part of the website that handles things behind the scenes (Next.js,
Genkit, and Firebase are involved here).
 AI/ML: AI models analyze data like resumes and job descriptions (using Genkit and
LLMs).
 UI Components: Ready-to-use elements (like buttons and forms) to make the website
look nice (shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS).
 Data Validation: Ensures the data being input is correct (using Zod).
 Email Service: Sends emails (using Nodemailer).
 Additional Libraries: Tools to handle icons, CSS classes, date formatting, and form
management (lucide-react, clsx, date-fns, react-hook-form).
